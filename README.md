- If you are a *git* user, you can click the *code* drop-down menu as illustrated in the picture above and copy the link to clone the repo.
- Now go to your terminal and type: `git clone <the link here>` and then the repo will be cloned to your local machine.
- By now you have to open your IDE -I recommend VSCode- and open the project.
- to open a live version from your local machine project, you can run the script `npm i`, this will download the dependencies and devDependencies, then run the command `num run dev` to open a hot server. By now you can go to you `localhost:3000` to see the project.
- If you don't have *git* in you command line, you can download the project as a zip file.
- Happy Coding!ðŸ¤ž
